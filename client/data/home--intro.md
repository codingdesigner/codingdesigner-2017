I'm a coding designer and design systems architect with twenty years of experience working with the most demanding global brands.

My process is grounded in deep thinking about brands, creative design concepts and UX. I design in the browser using the same tools as developers, creating a seamless integration from design inspiration to final production. I conceive the big picture and sweat every detail, every typeface, every space, every client concern, and the full continuum of device sizes.

If you're looking for someone to do creative and unique things with you, I just might be the [design](http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2013/06/27/the-myth-of-the-myth-of-the-unicorn-designer/#3734e3123504) [unicorn](http://blog.invisionapp.com/becoming-a-designer-who-codes/) you're hunting.

Letâ€™s [have fun together](#site-footer).
