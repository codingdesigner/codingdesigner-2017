Let’s get in tune.</p>\n        <p>Even in the age of Responsive Web Design, many sites are designed from the outside in. Whether the page is designed in Photoshop or, let’s hope, in-browser, many design projects slide out of tune when they get to the second or third page. Components are inconsistent, page and layout dimensions vary, font sizes shift. These details add up. Living style guides have been proposed to address this problem, the trouble is they’re often extracted from the finished project.</p>\n        <p>Let’s design the style guide first. Start from inside out with the most common aspects of a design language. Instead of envisioning individual pages, work to create a cohesive family of components and layouts that can be assembled into any page. By leveraging a tools that help us create the elements of out design language and visualize them in various contexts, we can make components, layouts, and even working pages that snap together beautifully. It’s the new blank paper.</p>",

Write some media queries for your layouts, some more for your menus, and even more to catch all the little details in a well-crafted design and they really add up.</p>\n      <p>I created a Sass extension called Breakpoint that lets you boil your media queries to their essential properties, and to give each one a meaningful name. This helps you write your styles more quickly, while also creating more maintainable and future-proof code. I'll demonstrate why this is needed and how it's become indespensible in my RWD toolset.</p>",

But one of the questions I've had is how to keep it all manageable - media queries for example.
